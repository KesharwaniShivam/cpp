/*
At the security checkpoint, airport security personnel have seized a number of travellersâ€™ belongings. Everything has been thrown into a big box (array). Each product carries a specific level of risk[0,1,2]. The risk severity of the items in this case is represented by an array[] of N integer values. Sorting the elements in the array according to the degrees of danger is the task at hand. Between 0 and 2 are the risk values.
Example :
Input :
7  -> Value of N
[1,0,2,0,1,0,2]-> Element of arr[0] to arr[N-1], while input each element is separated by new line.
Output :
0 0 0 1 1 2 2  -> Element after sorting based on risk severity
